# M64RPFW (Mupen64 Rerecording Plus Function Wrangler)
The frontend for a Mupen64Plus-based TASing emulator. Based on [Mupen64-RR](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-), which is under
continuous maintenance.

The eventual aim of this project is to serve as a replacement for Mupen64-RR that is based on up-to-date emulators and frameworks.
