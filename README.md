# M64RPFW (WIP)

A new TASing-oriented N64 emulator, written in C# using [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for UI. Designed to
work together with [mupen64plus-core-rr](https://github.com/Mupen64-Rewrite/mupen64plus-core-rr)
and [TASInput Qt](https://github.com/Mupen64-Rewrite/tas-input-qt).

### Where did the name come from?

**M**upen**64**Plus **R**erecording **P**lus **F**unction **W**rangler. The name was created by Aurumaker. The "Function
Wrangler" part was likely because of the hundreds of lines of native library bindings needed in this framework.

### When can I start using it?

It's not quite ready for use yet: the rerecording core is still missing audio capture, and this project still has quite
a few pieces of functionality left to implement.
